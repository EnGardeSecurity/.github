# ICS Range – Hands-On OT Security Training with Real Industrial Equipment

ICS Range is a 24/7 industrial-security training platform that closes the gap between classroom theory and plant-floor reality.  
We give IT/OT professionals, control engineers, and critical-infrastructure teams **on-demand access to live IACS/ICS/SCADA hardware** so they can learn, test, and validate security controls without risking production systems.
